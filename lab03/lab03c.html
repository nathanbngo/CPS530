            <p>The challenge I faced with Part A was that I had to type more code to create a fluid layout. I had control over everything but that caused it to be more time-consuming setting the sizing, alignment, and the elements. Another challenge I faced was getting both web pages to be the same. Matching the layout using CSS and Bootstrap was difficult because of the built-in components Bootstrap included and then having to manually do the same in CSS.</p>
            
            <p>Bootstrap is easier to use because of its grid system and built-in components, which makes it a lot easier to maintain a consistent design. On the other hand, CSS gave me more freedom in design. I prefer CSS media queries as it gives me more control of the design and layout of my webpage. However, I can see how others would prefer Bootstrap as it does help cut development time and simplify the development process. Overall both are very viable options when it comes to web development.</p>
