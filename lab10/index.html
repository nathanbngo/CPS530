        <h2>Problem 3: Hosting and Viewing My Project Online</h2>
        <p>
            In this part of the lab, I set up a website to host my project files using 
            <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, a free hosting platform. 
            I uploaded my files from the <strong>lab10</strong> folder, which included an 
            <code>index.html</code> file and other resources like images and CSS styles. 
            After deploying the project, I received a live URL that anyone can use to view my work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this task was to learn how to make a website publicly accessible and ensure 
            everything looks and works as intended. This included testing that all links, images, and styles 
            display correctly when accessed through the browser. Hosting the project online allows others to see it 
            from anywhere, making it easy to share and showcase.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can view the hosted project here: 
            <a href="https://your-site-name.netlify.app" target="_blank">https://your-site-name.netlify.app</a>
